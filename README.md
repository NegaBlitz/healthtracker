# Health Tracker 1.0
This app will allow the user to search the Nutritionix API for food items, and will allow the user to place them into a list by clicking on them. The total number of calories will be added up and displayed. The data is also saved to local storage, so returning to the app should have all of your previous options still there.

Simply run index.html in your browser to see the app!
