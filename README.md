# Health Tracker 1.0
This app will allow the user to search the Nutritionix API for food items, and will allow the user to place them into a list by clicking on them. The total number of calories will be added up and displayed. The data is also saved to local storage, so returning to the app should have all of your previous options still there.

Simply run index.html in your browser to see the app!

#### Other notes:
The search options do **not** disappear when they are clicked on, but this is by design. Instead, a clear button is implemented to get rid of the options in case of a misclick or to duplicate items (Eating 2 bananas, for instance, would require searching twice if the search entirely vanished, and I think that it wouldn't be good design).
